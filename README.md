# C3BO-Cancer-Blood-Oncologist
Inspired by the artificially learned robot C3PO from Star Wars, C3BO intends to help out patients by diagnosing them with Blood Cancer before a tumor metastasizes.


# Components of C3BO
Coded in tkinter, a C3PO with a red arm appears and asks for the user to input a file. The file must contain at least two images.
Additionally, there are two buttons: one for the use to input the images of their blood cells and the other to predict the patient's blood cancer (if they have blood cancer).
